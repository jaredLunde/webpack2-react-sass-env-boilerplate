# webpack2-react-sass-env-boilerplate
### A boilerplate for creating applications with Webpack 3+, Babel w/ babel-preset-env, React and SASS.

This package includes everything you need to start building an application with
Webpack 3, React and SASS.

## To use with a bash script:
1. Create `create-app` executable
```sh
echo '#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "No package name was provided."
  exit 1
fi

PKG_NAME=$1
mkdir $PKG_NAME
cd $PKG_NAME
npm init -y
npm install webpack2-react-sass-env-boilerplate
cp -r ./node_modules/webpack2-react-sass-env-boilerplate/. ./
mv package.json.tpl package.json
find . -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ejs" -o -name "*.json" \) -and -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -exec sed -i.bak -e "s/{{PKG_NAME}}/${PKG_NAME}/g" {} \;;
find . -type f -name "*.bak" -and -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -exec rm {} \;;
mv "./assets/css/{{PKG_NAME}}" "./assets/css/${PKG_NAME}"
npm start' > create-app
```

2. Make sure you can execute the script
```sh
chmod 0744 create-app
```

3. Execute the script w/ a package name
```sh
./create-app your-pkg-name
```

### package.json
Here you'll find a list of devDependencies for creating this type of
application, however, they are listed under 'dependencies' since I use this
project as a grouped devDependency in my personal projects.


### package.json.tpl
Here is an example of what your package.json might look like, were you to
use this package as a devDependency. Should you choose to do so, you can
install this package with the command:

`npm install --save-dev webpack2-react-sass-env-boilerplate`


### server.js
Using the command `NODE_ENV=development && node server.js` will start your
application with hot module reloading on port `:3000` of your localhost, using
the webpack configuration at `webpack.config.dev.js` and the index file at
`index.html`.


### webpack.config.dev.js
This is an example of a basic development webpack configuration file for this
type of application.


### webpack.config.js
This is an example of a basic distribution webpack configuration file for this
type of application. Commented out are examples of implementing Modernizr and
http2 aggressive code splitting.


### .babelrc
This is an example of a basic Babel 6 configuration utilizing babel-preset-env.


### /src
This is where example index files for both hot reloading (`index.hot.js`) and
distribution builds (`index.js`) are located, as well as the 'Hello world'
React component (`App.js`).


### /assets
Development Javascript files are output to this folder from
`webpack.config.dev.js` and static assets such as images and SASS can be
placed in here.
